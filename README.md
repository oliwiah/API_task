# API task
The aim was to practice API requests. I chose to work with [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/) and created an application with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki).

## Technologies used
* Angular 7
* Angular Material
* SCSS
* Ajax / Fetch API
* Lodash
* RxJS
* Surge

## Running the app
To run the application on your machine:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open it in your IDE.
3. Run `npm i` and then `ng serve --open`.

The app should open in your browser.
